/* What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects, where each node is an element (like a <div>, <p>, or <button>).
With JavaScript, you can manipulate the DOM by accessing, modifying, and updating these elements in real-time.
Basic DOM Access:

Selecting Elements: How to select HTML elements to manipulate them.
Modifying Elements: How to change content, styles, and attributes.
Basic DOM Manipulation Methods:

Adding, Removing, and Modifying Elements: Dynamically add, remove, and change elements in the DOM.
Event Handling: Respond to user interactions like clicks or keyboard presses.
