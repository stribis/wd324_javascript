1. Palindrome Permutation
Write a function to check if a given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome.
-> A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
-> e.g. "radar", "level", "madam"

2. Array Flattening
Write a recursive function to flatten a nested array.
-> To flatten a nested array means to take an array that contains other arrays (potentially at multiple levels of nesting) and convert it into a single-level array where all elements are at the same level.

3. Find Unique Triplets
Find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.
-> Identify groups of three numbers from the array that, when added together, result in a sum of zero

4. Validate Parentheses
Validate whether a string of parentheses is balanced.
-> Balanced means that on every opening piece there is a closing one too.

5. Spiral Matrix
Given a 2D array, return its elements in spiral order.
-> Spiral order: starting from the top-left corner and moving outward in a clockwise direction. The traversal typically follows this sequence:

6.  Isomorphic Strings
Write a function to determine if two strings are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in one string can be replaced to get the second string, maintaining the order.
-> isomorphic: there is a one-to-one mapping between the elements of the two structures, preserving their relationships or patterns.
   Two strings are isomorphic if:
    1. Characters in one string can be replaced to get the other string.
    2. The mapping between characters is consistent.


7. Unique Character in a String
Write a function to find the first non-repeating character in a string. If all characters repeat, return null.

8. Frequency Counter
Given an array, write a function to count the frequency of each element and return an object.

9. Anagram Check
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
-> An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. 
The rearrangement must result in a valid word or phrase.
Examples of Anagrams:
    - "listen" → "silent"
    - "earth" → "heart"
    - "evil" → "vile"

10. Chunk an Array
Write a function to split an array into chunks of a given size.

11. Flatten an Object
Write a function to flatten a nested object into a single-level object, with keys representing the nested path.

12. Remove Duplicates from an Array
Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array.

13. Find Missing Numbers
Given an array of numbers from 1 to N with some missing numbers, find all the missing numbers.

14. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Write a function to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

15. Merge and Sort Two Arrays
Write a function to merge two arrays and return a sorted array with unique values.

16. Most Frequent Element
Write a function to find the most frequently occurring element in an array. If there is a tie, return any one of the most frequent elements.

17. Capitalize Words
Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

18. Deep Equality Check
Write a function to check if two objects are deeply equal. The objects may contain nested structures.
-> deeply means every nested element is equal too, no matter the depth level

19. Reverse Words in a String
Write a function to reverse the words in a given string, while maintaining their original order.

20.  Array Intersection
Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays (elements that are common to both arrays).
