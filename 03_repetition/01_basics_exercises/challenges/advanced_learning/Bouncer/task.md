Create a function canEnterClub that takes a person's age and whether they have a membership card as arguments. The function should return:

    "Allowed" if the person is 21 or older and has a membership card.
    "Denied" otherwise.

Also, create a button on an HTML page that runs this function and displays the result in a paragraph when clicked.
