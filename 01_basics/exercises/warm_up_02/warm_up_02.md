# Warm Up: "The Magic Number Game"

### Objective:
Create a small program that asks the user to guess a "magic number" based on certain conditions. 
The program will guide the user based on their guesses and give hints using conditionals and loops. 
The program will use various datatypes, loops, conditionals, and a function.

### Instructions:
Hint: Use alert() and prompt() from browser window methods for easy user interaction
 - `alert("your text")` will show a little pop-up with a message in the browser
 - `prompt("text for user input", default value)`
1. **Magic Number**: Start by choosing a secret "magic number" (e.g., 15).
2. **Datatype Exploration**:
    - Use strings to ask the user for input.
    - Ask the user for a guess
    - Use numbers to represent the magic number and to compare against the user's guesses. 
    - `let intString = parseInt(string)` for parsing a string to an int
3. **Conditionals**: The program should tell the user whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. **Loops**: Keep asking the user for guesses until they guess the correct number.
5. **Function**: Create a function that checks whether the guess is correct and provides the appropriate response.
